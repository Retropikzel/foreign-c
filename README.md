# Portable Foreign Function Interface for R7RS schemes

Foreign function interface that is supported on multiple R7RS Sceheme implementations.

Note that this software is in alpha stage.

Any help in form of constructive advice, bug reports, feature suggestions are appreciated.



Got a [bug](https://codeberg.org/r7rs-pffi/pffi/projects/9101)?

Got a [feature suggestion](https://codeberg.org/r7rs-pffi/pffi/projects/9102)?

Got a [question](https://codeberg.org/r7rs-pffi/pffi/projects/9575)?

## Goals

- Support only R7RS implementations
  - Needs to have cond-expand and library support atleast (propably much more)
- Same interface on all implementations
  - Some things that are procedures on one implementation are macros on other,
  but they must behave the same

## Non goals

- To support all R7RS implementations
- To have every possible FFI feature
- Compiling of C code at any point
    - That is no stubs, no C code generated by the library and so on

## All tests (there is not that many yet) pass

- [Sagittarius](https://bitbucket.org/ktakashi/sagittarius-scheme/wiki/Home)
- [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/)
- [Kawa](https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/index.html)
    - Needs atleast java 21
    - Needs jvm flags
        - java --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.foreign.abi=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.foreign.layout=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.foreign=ALL-UNNAMED --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED --enable-preview -jar kawa.jar FILENAME.scm
- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)
- [Chicken](https://www.call-cc.org/)

## Not all tests pass

- [STKlos](https://stklos.net/)
- [Cyclone](https://justinethier.github.io/cyclone/)
- [Gambit](https://gambitscheme.org)

## Support waiting for the implementation

- [LIPS](https://lips.js.org/)
  - Waiting for implementation to have cond-expand and library support
  - Will only work on nodejs

## Support needs to be investigated

- [Gerbil](https://cons.io/)

## Support maybe possible/dreaming about

- [Airship](https://gitlab.com/mbabich/airship-scheme)

## Not supported

- [Chibi](https://synthcode.com/scheme/chibi)
    - FFI requires C code
- [MIT-Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/)
    - FF requires C code
- [tr7](https://gitlab.com/jobol/tr7)
    - FFI requires C code
- [Gauche](https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/)
    - FFI requires C code
- [Loko](https://scheme.fail/)
    - Desires no C interop, I can respect that


## Hacking

main.sld is the real main which is copied to main.scm

### Pull requests
Pull requests for bug fixes, additional implementation support and additional tests are appreciated.
But please do not change the interface (library exports) and if you add support for implementation
then all exported procedures of main.sld need to be implemented and tests must pass.

## Documentation

On some implementations these are procedures, on some macros.

The arguments are in form

- NAME - TYPE

The return value is in form

- TYPE

### Types

Types are given as symbols, for example 'int8 or 'pointer.

- int8
- uint8
- int16
- uint16
- int32
- uint32
- int64
- uint64
- char
- unsigned-char
- short
- unsigned-short
- int
- unsigned-int
- long
- unsigned-long
- float
- double
- string
- pointer


### Procedures or macros

#### pffi-shared-object-auto-load

Arguments:

- headers - (list string ...)
  - C headers of the library
  - For example (list "curl/curl.h")
- object-name - symbol
  - The name of the dynamic library file you want to load
  - Without the "lib" in front of it
  - Without the ".so" or ".dll" at the end
- additional-versions - (list string...)
  - For example (list ".0" ".1")
- additional-paths - (list string...)
  - Any additional paths you want to search for the library
  - For example (list "./mylibs")

Returns:

- object
    - Shared object, the type depends on the implementation

#### pffi-shared-object-load

  It is recommended to use the pffi-shared-object-auto-load instead of this
  directly.

Arguments:

- headers - (list string ...)
    - Headers that need to be included
    - Example (list "curl/curl.h")
- path - string
    - The full path to the shared object you want to load, including any "lib" infront and .so/.dll at the end
    - Example "libcurl.so"

Returns:

- object
    - Shared object, the type depends on the implementation



#### pffi-define

Defines new foreign procedure.

Arguments:

- scheme-name
    - The name of the procedure used on scheme side
- shared-object - object
    - The shared object
    - Use pffi-shared-object-auto-load or pffi-shared-object-load to get this
- c-name - symbol
    - The name of the C function
- return-type - symbol
    - The return type of the C function
- arguments-types - (list symbol ...)
    - The C function argument types

### pffi-size-of

Get the size of type.

Arguments:

- type - symbol
    - The type you want the size of

Returns:

- number
    - The size of the given type


### pffi-pointer-allocate

Allocates a pointer of given size.

Arguments:

- size - number
    - The size of the pointer you want to allocate

Returns:

- object
    - A pointer of given size


### pffi-pointer-null

Create a null pointer.

Returns:
- object
    - Null pointer

### pffi-string->pointer

Arguments:

- string-content - string
    - The string you want to transform into pointer

Returns:

- object
    - Pointer of the given string


### pffi-pointer->string

Arguments:

- pointer - object
    - The pointer you want to transform to string

Returns:

- string
    - String from the given pointer

### pffi-pointer-free

Arguments:

- pointer - object
    - The pointer you want to free

### pffi-pointer?

Arguments:

- object - object
    - The object you want to check wether it is a pointer or not

Returns:

- boolean
    - Returns true if given object is pointer, otherwise false


### pffi-pointer-set!

Arguments:

- pointer - object
    - The pointer you want to modify
- type - symbol
    - The type of value that will be put into the pointer
- offset -number
    - The location of the value inside the pointer
    - For example: (+ (pffi-size-of 'int) (pffi-size-of 'pointer)) or 0
- value - object
    - The value to be placed into the object

### pffi-pointer-get

Arguments:

- pointer - object
    - The pointer you want to get the value from
- type - symbol
    - The type of value you want to get
    - For example: 'int
- offset - number
    - The location of the value inside the pointer
    - For example: (+ (pffi-size-of 'int) (pffi-size-of 'pointer)) or 0

Returns:

- object
    - The value in the poiner in the given offset as given type

### pffi-pointer-deref

Arguments:

- pointer
    - The pointer to dereference

Returns:

- object
    - Whatever the pointer holds
