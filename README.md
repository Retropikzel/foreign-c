## Installation

Not yet installable with snow-fort:

- Gauche
    - Use manual installation



### Snow-fort


[https://snow-fort.org/](https://snow-fort.org/)

snow-chibi --impls=IMPLEMENTATION install "(foreign c)"

You can test that library is found by your implementation like this:

    cp tests/hello.scm /tmp/hello.scm
    cd /tmp
    IMPLEMENTATION hello.scm



### Manual system wide

Manual system wide installation requires snow-chibi.

Either download the latest release from
[https://git.sr.ht/~retropikzel/foreign-c/refs](https://git.sr.ht/~retropikzel/foreign-c/refs)
or git clone, tag, and copy the foreign directory to your
library directory.

Example for how to install for Gauche:

    apt-get install libffi-dev
    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~retropikzel/foreign-c
    cd foreign-c
    make SCHEME=gauche
    make SCHEME=gauche install



### Manual for project

Either download the latest release from
[https://git.sr.ht/~retropikzel/foreign-c/refs](https://git.sr.ht/~retropikzel/foreign-c/refs)
or git clone, tag, and copy the foreign directory to your
library directory.

Example assuming libraries in directory snow:

    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~retropikzel/foreign-c --branch LATEST_VERSION
    cd foreign-c
    make SCHEME_IMPLEMENTATION_NAME
    cd ..
    mkdir -p snow
    cp -r foreign-c/foreign snow/

With most implementations the make command does not compile anything. When that
is the case it will say "Nothing to build on SCHEME\_IMPLEMENTATION\_NAME."

### Primitives 1



(**c-type-size** type)

Returns the size of given C type.



(**define-c-library** scheme-name headers object-name options)

Takes a scheme-name to bind the library to, list of C headers as
strings, shared-object name and options.

The C header strings should not contain "<" or ">", they are added
automatically.

The name of the shared object should not contain suffix like .so or .dll.
Nor should it contain any prefix like "lib".

Options:

- additional-versions
    - Search for additional versions of shared object, given shared object "c"
    and additional versions "6" "7" on linux the files "libc", "libc.6",
    "libc.7" are searched for.
    - Can be either numbers or strings
- additional-paths
    - Give additional paths to search shared objects from

Example:

    (define-c-library libc
                      (list "stdlib.h")
                      libc-name
                      '((additional-versions ("" "0" "6"))
                        (additional-paths ("."))))



#### Notes

- Do not cond-expand inside the arguments, that might lead to problems on some
implementations.
- Do not store options in variables, that might lead to problems on some
implementations.
- Pass the headers using quote
    - As '(...) and not (list...)
- Pass the options using quote
    - As '(...) and not (list...)



(**define-c-procedure** scheme-name shared-object c-name return-type
argument-type)

Takes a scheme-name to bind the C procedure to, shared-object where the function
is looked from, c-name of the function as symbol, return-type and argument-types.

Defines a new foreign function to be used from Scheme code.


Example:

    (define-c-library libc '("stdlib.h") libc-name '("6"))
    (define-c-procedure c-puts libc 'puts 'int '(pointer))
    (c-puts "Message brought to you by foreign-c!")



#### Notes

- Pass the return-types using quote
    - As '(...) and not (list...)



(**c-bytevector?** obj)



Returns #t if obj is c-bytevector, otherwise returns #f.



(**c-bytevector-u8-set!** c-bytevector k byte)

If K is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Stores the byte in element k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-u8-ref** c-bytevector k)

If K is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Returns the byte at index k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-pointer-set!** c-bytevector k pointer)

If K is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Stores the pointer(which is also c-bytevector) in element k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-pointer-ref**  c-bytevector k pointer)

If K is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Returns the pointer(which is also c-bytevector) at index k of c-bytevector.




### Primitives 2


(**define-c-callback** scheme-name return-type argument-types procedure)

Takes scheme-name to bind the Scheme procedure to, return-type, argument-types
and procedure as in place lambda.

Defines a new Sceme function to be used as callback to C code.

Example:

    ; Load the shared library
    (define-c-library libc-stdlib '("stdlib.h") libc-name '("" "6"))

    ; Define C function that takes a callback
    (define-c-procedure qsort libc-stdlib 'qsort 'void '(pointer int int callback))

    ; Define our callback
    (define-c-callback compare
                          'int
                          '(pointer pointer)
                          (lambda (pointer-a pointer-b)
                            (let ((a (c-bytevector-sint-get pointer-a (native-endianness) 0))
                                  (b (c-bytevector-sint-get pointer-b (native-endianness) 0)))
                              (cond ((> a b) 1)
                                    ((= a b) 0)
                                    ((< a b) -1)))))

    ; Create new array of ints to be sorted
    (define array (make-c-bytevector (* (c-type-size 'int) 3)))
    (c-bytevector-s32-native-set! array (* (c-type-size 'int) 0) 3)
    (c-bytevector-s32-native-set! array (* (c-type-size 'int) 1) 2)
    (c-bytevector-s32-native-set! array (* (c-type-size 'int) 2) 1)

    (display array)
    (newline)
    ;> (3 2 1)

    ; Sort the array
    (qsort array 3 (c-type-size 'int) compare)

    (display array)
    (newline)
    ;> (1 2 3)



### c-bytevector

Foreign-c c-bytevector interface is copied from R6RS bytevectors, with some
added functionality for C null pointers and manual memory management.



(**make-c-null**)

Returns a null C pointer.



(**c-null?** obj)



Returns **#t** if obj is a null C pointer, otherwise returns **#f**.



(**c-free** c-bytevector)

Frees c-bytevector from memory.



(**call-with-address-of** c-bytevector thunk)

Calls thunk with address pointer of c-bytevector.

Since the support for calling C functions taking pointer address arguments,
ones prefixed with & in C, varies, some additional ceremony is needed on
the Scheme side.

Example:

Calling from C:

    //void func(int** i);
    func(&i);

Calling from Scheme:

    (define cbv (make-bytevector (c-type-size 'int)))
    (call-with-address-of
     cbv
     (lambda (address)
      (func address)))
    ; Use cbv here

The passed c-bytevector, in example named cbv, should only be used **after**
call to call-with-addres-of ends.



(**bytevector->c-bytevector** bytevector)

Returns a newly allocated c-bytevector of the bytes of bytevector.



(**c-bytevector->bytevector**)

Returns a newly allocated bytevector of the bytes of c-bytevector.



(**native-endianness**)

Returns the endianness symbol associated implementation’s preferred endianness
(usually that of the underlying machine architecture).  This may be any
\<endianness symbol\>, including a symbol other than big and little.



(**make-c-bytevector** k)<br></br>
(**make-c-bytevector** k fill)

Returns a newly allocated c-bytevector of k bytes.

If the fill argument is missing, the initial contents of the
returned c-bytevector are unspecified.

If the fill argument is present, it's value must confine to C uint8t values
, it specifies the initial value for the bytes of the c-bytevector




(**c-bytevector-s8-set!** c-bytevector k byte)

If k is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Stores the byte in element k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-s8-ref** c-bytevector k)

If k is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Returns the byte at index k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-char-set!** c-bytevector k char)

If k is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Stores the char in element k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-char-ref** c-bytevector k)

If k is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Returns the char at index k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-uchar-set!** c-bytevector k char)

If k is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Stores the unsigned char in element k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-uchar-ref** c-bytevector k)

If k is not a valid index of c-bytevector the behaviour is undefined.

Returns the unsigned char at index k of c-bytevector.



(**c-bytevector-uint-ref** c-bytevector k endianness size)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-sint-ref** c-bytevector k endianness size)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-uint-set!** c-bytevector k n endianness size)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-sint-set!** c-bytevector k n endianness size)

Size must be a positive exact integer object. If k,...,k + size − 1 is
not valid indices of c-bytevector the behavior is unspecified.

The c-bytevector-uint-ref procedure retrieves the exact integer object
corresponding to the unsigned representation of size size and specified by
endianness at indices k,...,k + size − 1.

The c-bytevector-sint-ref procedure retrieves the exact integer object
corresponding to the two’s-complement representation of size size and
specified by endianness at indices k,...,k + size − 1.  For
c-bytevector-uint-set!, n must be an exact integer object in the interval
{0,...,256^size − 1}.

The c-bytevector-uint-set! procedure stores the unsigned representation of
size size and specified by endianness into c-bytevector at indices
k,...,k + size − 1.

The . . . -set! procedures return unspecified values.

Examples:

    (define cbv (make-c-bytevector (c-type-size 'int)))
    (c-bytevector-sint-set! cbv 0 100 (native-endianness) (c-type-size 'int))
    (c-bytevector-sint-ref cbv 0 (native-endianness) (c-type-size 'int))
    > 100

c-bytevector-s16-native-set!, n must be an exact integer object in the
interval {−215,...,215 − 1}.

These retrieve and set two-byte representations of numbers at indices k and
k + 1, according to the endianness specified by endianness. The procedures
with u16 in their names deal with the unsigned representation; those with s16
in their names deal with the two’s-complement representation.

The procedures with native in their names employ the native endianness, and
work only at aligned indices: k must be a multiple of 2.

The ...-set!  procedures return unspecified values.

The procedures with u32 in their names deal with the unsigned representation;
those with s32 with the two’s-complement representation.

The procedures with native in their names employ the native endianness, and
work only at aligned indices: k must be a multiple of 4.

The ...-set!  procedures return unspecified values.



(**c-bytevector-u64-ref** c-bytevector k endianness)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-s64-ref** c-bytevector k endianness)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-u64-native-ref** c-bytevector k)<br></br>

(**c-bytevector-s64-native-set!** c-bytevector k n)

K,...,k + 7 must be valid indices of c-bytevector.  For
c-bytevector-u64-set! and c-bytevector-u64-native-set!, n must be an exact

c-bytevector-s64-native-set!, n must be an exact integer object in the
interval {−263,...,264 − 1}.

These retrieve and set eight-byte representations of numbers at indices
k,...,k + 7, according to the endianness specified by endianness. The
procedures with u64 in their names deal with the unsigned representation; those
with s64 with the two’s-complement representation.

The procedures with native in their names employ the native endianness, and
work only at aligned indices: k must be a multiple of 8.

The ...-set! procedures return unspecified values.



(**c-bytevector-ieee-single-native-ref**)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-ieee-single-ref**)<br></br>

K,...,k + 3 must be valid indices of c-bytevector. For
c-bytevector-ieee-single-native-ref, k must be a multiple of 4.

K,...,k + 7 must be valid indices of c-bytevector. For
c-bytevector-ieee-double-native-ref, k must be a multiple of 8.

These procedures return the inexact real number object that best represents the
IEEE-754 double-precision number represented by the eight bytes beginning at
index k.



(**c-bytevector-ieee-single-native-set!**)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-ieee-single-set!**)

K,...,k + 3 must be valid indices of c-bytevector. For
c-bytevector-ieee-single-native-set!, k must be a multiple of 4.

These procedures store an IEEE-754 single-precision representation of x into
elements k through k + 3 of bytevector, and return unspecified values.



(**c-bytevector-ieee-double-native-set!**)<br></br>
(**c-bytevector-ieee-double-set!**)

K,...,k + 7 must be valid indices of bytevector. For
c-bytevector-ieee-double-native-set!, k must be a multiple of 8.

These procedures store an IEEE-754 double-precision representation of x into
elements k through k + 7 of bytevector, andreturn unspecified values.




(**string->c-utf8** string)

Returns a newly allocated (unless empty) c-bytevector that contains the
UTF-8 encoding of the given string.



(**c-utf8->string** c-bytevector)

Returns a newly allocated string whose character sequence is
encoded by the given c-bytevector. It is an error if c-bytevector is null.



### c-array



(**make-c-array** type size)<br></br>
(**make-c-array** type size fill)

If the fill argument is missing, the initial contents of the
returned c-bytevector are unspecified.

If the fill argument is present, it specifies the initial value for the items
of the array.  If it's value does not match type behaviour is unspecified.

Returns a newly allocated c-bytevector with size of type times size.



(**c-array-ref** array type index)

array is a c-bytevector.

Returns the given value of type from index of array. If the value is not
of type or index is out of bounds the behaviour is unspecified.



(**c-array-set!** array type index value)

array is a c-bytevector.

Sets the given value of type at index of array. If value is not of
type or index is out of bounds behaviour is unspecified.



(**list->c-array** list type)

Returns newly allocated c-bytevector with values of the list in it. List
values must be of type. If the values are not of type behaviour is
unspecified.



(**c-array->list** array type size)

array is a c-bytevector.

Returns a list with values of array in it. If type and size_ do not match
what is in the c-bytevector the behaviour is unspecified.



### Utilities



**libc-name**

Name of the C standard library on the current operating system. Supported OS:

- Windows
- Linux
- Haiku

See foreign/c/libc.scm to see which headers are included and what shared
libraries are loaded.

Example:

    (define-c-library libc '("stdlib.h") libc-name '("" "6"))
    (define-c-procedure c-puts libc 'puts 'int '(pointer))
    (c-puts "Message brought to you by foreign-c!")



### Environment variables

Setting environment variables like this on Windows works for this library:

    set "FOREIGN_C_LOAD_PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)/foo/bar"



#### FOREIGN\_C_\_LOAD\_PATH

To add more paths to where foreign c looks for libraries set
FOREIGN\_C\_LOAD\_PATH to paths separated by ; on windows, and : on other
operating systems.
