# r7rs-pffi

Portable Foreign Function Interface for R7RS schemes

Foreign function interface that is supported on multiple R7RS Sceheme implementations.

Note that this software is in alpha stage. That said the interface should not be changing anymore.

Any help in form of constructive advice and bug reports are appreciated.
